"""
An attempt at a code (in principle) which (i) takes a text, (ii) identifies a series of collocations which are related to 
business or being in an office, and (iii) returns a definition of said collocation for an English-language
learner to find in the text.

ocolls = office collocations

ocollsdefs = office collocations definitions. 

This code does not work. There is invalid syntax after the below line:

    for any(x in newstr for x in (x,y) in ocollsdefs)
    
Any help would be appreciated!
